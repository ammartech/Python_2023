## Usage

1. Enter your weight in kilograms.
2. Enter your age.
3. Click the **Calculate** button.
4. The application will display your recommended water intake.

## Methodology

The water intake calculation in the Water Calculator is based on the following formula:

```
water_intake = (weight / 2.2) * (age / 28.3) / 8
```

The weight is divided by 2.2 to convert it from kilograms to pounds, and the age is divided by 28.3 to convert it from years to months. The result is then divided by 8 to convert it from fluid ounces to cups. This calculation provides an estimation of the recommended water intake.
