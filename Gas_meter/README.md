# Gas Meter Reading and Consumption Calculation Program

The Gas Meter Reading and Consumption Calculation Program is a software application that allows users to monitor and track their gas consumption. It provides an easy way to input gas meter readings and calculates the amount of gas consumed based on the difference between the current reading and the previous reading. This program helps users manage their gas consumption efficiently and make informed decisions regarding energy usage.

## Features

- **Gas Meter Reading Input:** Users can enter the current gas meter reading into the program. If they are existing subscribers, they can also provide the previous reading for accurate consumption calculation.

- **Consumption Calculation:** The program calculates the gas consumption by subtracting the previous reading from the current reading. It handles cases where the readings are negative or incorrect, prompting users to enter the correct values.

- **Differentiation for New and Existing Subscribers:** Users can specify if they are new subscribers or existing subscribers. For new subscribers, the consumption is considered as the current reading only. For existing subscribers, the consumption is calculated based on the difference between the current and previous readings.

- **Data Storage:** The program maintains a list or database of gas consumption values, allowing users to store and track their consumption history over time. This data can be accessed for future reference or analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** The program may include features to visualize the gas consumption data, such as generating graphs or charts to depict consumption trends and patterns. This helps users analyze their usage and make informed decisions regarding gas consumption.
