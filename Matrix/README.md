## Introduction

Matrix operations are fundamental in various fields such as mathematics, engineering, and computer science. The Matrix Operations Application allows users to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, concatenation, and finding the inverse of a matrix. This application is implemented in Python from scratch, providing a hands-on approach to understanding matrix operations and their implementation.

## Features

- Matrix Addition: Perform addition of two matrices of the same dimensions.
- Matrix Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two matrices of the same dimensions.
- Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices, considering the appropriate dimensions.
- Matrix Transpose: Find the transpose of a matrix.
- Matrix Concatenation: Concatenate two matrices vertically, assuming compatible dimensions.
- Matrix Inverse: Calculate the inverse of a square matrix.

## Methodology

1. **User Input:** The application prompts the user to provide input for the desired matrix operation, along with any necessary matrix dimensions and elements.

2. **Matrix Operations Functions:** Separate functions are defined for each matrix operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, concatenation, and finding the inverse.

3. **Computation:** The functions perform the necessary computations using nested loops and mathematical operations to achieve the desired matrix operation.

4. **Result Display:** The computed result is displayed to the user.

5. **Menu Loop:** The application presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose the desired matrix operation or exit the program.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of each matrix operation function varies:

- Matrix Addition, Subtraction, and Transpose: O(rows * columns)
- Matrix Multiplication: O(rows1 * cols1 * cols2)
- Matrix Concatenation: O(rows)
- Matrix Inverse: O(n^3)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/matrix-operations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd matrix-operations
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python matrix_operations.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Choose the desired matrix operation from the menu.
2. Provide the required input for matrix dimensions and elements.
3. The application will compute the result and display it.
