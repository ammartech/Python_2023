# AI Math Assistant

The AI Math Assistant is a Python-based application that provides various mathematical calculations and functionalities. It leverages the power of symbolic mathematics, statistical calculations, and graphing capabilities to assist users with their mathematical needs.

> "Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms. It is about understanding." - William Paul Thurston

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Differentiation and integration of mathematical expressions.
- Statistical calculations: Mean, median, and mode.
- Trigonometric functions: Sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Logarithmic function calculation.
- Graphing of functions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-math-assistant.git


2. Change to the project directory:


cd ai-math-assistant


3. Install the required dependencies:


pip install sympy statistics matplotlib numpy


## Usage

1. Run the Python script:


python ai_math_assistant.py


2. Enter a math expression when prompted. Examples:

- Basic arithmetic: `2 + 3`, `4 * 5`
- Differentiation: `diff(x^2)`
- Integration: `int(x^2)`
- Statistical calculations: `mean 1 2 3`, `median 4 5 6`
- Trigonometric functions: `sin(0.5)`, `tan(1.2)`
- Logarithmic function: `log(2, 8)`
- Graphing: `graph(x^2)`

3. View the result or graph displayed on the interface.
